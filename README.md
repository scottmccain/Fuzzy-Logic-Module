###### A C# library to implement fuzzy logic

> What is fuzzy logic?  We are all familiar with the normal boolean logic that is implemented using a true/false mechanism.  
Statements in boolean logic can either be true or they can be false, but nothing inbetween.  This sort of logic works well with 
computers since computers are operated, at the very basic level, by switches.  A switch can either be on, or it can be off, it can't 
be inbetween.  Boolean logic fits well for that.

> In the real world, however, there are many cases when determining something isn't so cut and dry.  In nature it's very hard to find 
systems or mechanisms that are always true or always false given the same inputs.  Many times it's difficult to model these natural 
phenomenom using a true/false mechanism or boolean logic.  

> A simple example is when trying to make a decision if you need to stop for gas before driving home.  You take into account many of 
the current conditions, such as weather, driving conditions, traffic, and so on, as well as the amount of gas you have left coupled 
with your driving style before you make your decision.  Maybe it's raining and you are a hard driver and the nearest gas station once 
you start your trip is very far away.  

> Again, the output from that "function" won't be a cut and dry "yes" or "no", there will be degrees of yes and no.  What are called 
degrees of membership.  Maybe there are more degrees of membership in "yes" than in "no" which would result in a decision that favors 
the "yes" condition.
